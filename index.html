         TRASHCAN LOVE

          Edges spilling with grease and food scraps
          pour me out take me out
          I am decomposing fruit and plastic bags
          empty my jizz rags, my condom wrappers I used with you
          I don’t want to smell that rotting shit any more
          I don’t want to

          I started empty for you
          And filled with discarded thoughts and memories
          These things would build until I started rotting and festering
          Occasionally I took myself out and dumped out to become anew
          I can’t stop the flow of things generated by you
          They accumulate like garbage

          Now I am brimming with refuse
          I am acrid I can be smelled from a block away
          Nobody wants to come near me
          I am steaming putrid for you
          Please come pour me out and rinse me
          I can’t do it any more the things I am trying to toss away just keep piling up
          Stop holding your nose and staring just fucking pour me out like you used to
          Please or I will rot to death in this corner

         SUNSHINE

         The times I think about you it's like when a ray of sunshine shines through a gap in a tree and hits me in the eye
         For a second I forget what I was thinking and I'm like agh fuck I can't see
       </div>
       <div id="telltale">
         FETAL POSITION

         Here we are all in the fetal position
         at the mercy of our maker
         rubbing the floor boards like vaseline into our skin
         cursing the sky while we can't see it
         cause the ceiling contains us within

         Like a cheap porno flick theater I will continue
         to feed quarters in to get off to my own sadness
         I am locked in here like the booth
         deciding between yelling in pain and jerking off or both

         When I think of the things I said and did
         it makes me so sick I want to masturbate

         When I cum it sits there like the obvious truth I hide from
         and when I wipe it away it's not like it's not there any more
       </div>
       <div id="warmth">
         WARMTH

         When I look out into the street and take a bite of my pizza
         It burns my mouth a little but that's okay
         The warmth through the crust on my hands warms me like you do
         The cheese falls apart so freely like the way things transpire between us
         These thoughts and realizations are like the parmesan cheese in my life
         Things always taste better with it
         Things are always better with you
